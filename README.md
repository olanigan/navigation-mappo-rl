# Multi Agent Navigation

This project focuses on multi-agent navigation in a 2D plane.

## Project Description
The core task involves multiple agents (represented as colored circles and arrow-heads) navigating from their starting positions to their respective end goals while avoiding collisions with other agents and static obstacles. The primary approach will be Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a focus on local control for each agent. Future work may explore the integration of inter-agent communication to enhance navigation strategies.

## Key Features
- **2D Environment:** A simulated 2D environment for navigation.
- **Multi-Agent System:** Support for multiple intelligent agents.
- **Collision Avoidance:** Agents learn to avoid collisions with both obstacles and other agents.
- **Goal-Oriented Navigation:** Agents aim to reach predefined end goals.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Utilizing RL techniques for agent control.
- **Local Control:** Initial focus on decentralized control for each agent.
- **Potential for Communication:** Future exploration into inter-agent communication.

## Roadmap
  - [ ]  Implement basic 2D environment with static obstacles.
  - [ ]  Develop single-agent reinforcement learning model for goal-oriented navigation.
  - [ ]  Extend to multi-agent system with collision avoidance (agent-obstacle and agent-agent).
  - [ ]  Optimize local control strategies for efficient navigation.
